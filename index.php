                <h3>Reviews</h3>
                <p>The children at kid college love the taste of Penny Juice, and drink it without encouragement from our teachers.</p>
                <p>I like Penny Juice for that reason and because it is 100% juice from concentrate requiring no refrigeration prior to mixing. The handy mix pitcher take the guess work out of preparation</p>
